Some options are working, some aren't.
For example:
- "-x rak" successfully launches rakarrack
- but -a does not launch audacity

Now, onto figuring out why not qjackctl presets loading.
Seems also to be an option error ... ???


Now onto - can we programmatically load qjackctl presets?
Because we need to reload or refresh the preset *after* everything
   else is open.

As an alternative, what if it switches focus between windows and puts
   qjackctl in front for you to do something?






New thought:
Would it be possible to make a unity launcher that allows you to drag
   wav files onto the Borderlands icon, and have it copy those files
   into /loops/????????????????//
At the very least there should be a right click option for "Open loops folder"
