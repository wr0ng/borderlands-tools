- Add to README:
After everything opens, you may find that only the left or right
   channel of Borderlands is feeding into Rakarrack. Check the meters;
   this happens every time on my computer. The fix is to do this:
1. Switch windows to QjackCtl
2. Click "Patchbay"
3. There will be a dropdown that says `rak_audacity`. Click the
   "Activate" button to the right of it.
That should do it!

This is a general tip to do with using JACK and/or QjackCtl. Sometimes
   after closing and reopening QjackCtl, I find that it can't start up
   properly. If this happens to you, close it. Then open a new
   terminal. Execute `ps -A | grep jackdbus`. This will display the
   process identifier for jackdbus (the number on the left). You want to kill it; execute `kill
   -9 <somenumber>` but replace `<somenumber>` with jackdbus's process
   identifier. Now QjackCtl should be able to restart JACK without a hitch.


- Write a TODO detailing every planned change
   - Switch back to text-based playback and recording as the default;
   - Use straight JACK (maybe even no QjackCtl) for plumbing:
   seemingly it's actually easier to use commands to connect programs
   persistently, than to use a graphical interface http://digitaldub.wordpress.com/2009/12/16/linux-audio-session-scripting/
