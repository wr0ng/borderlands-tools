1) make select_audiofile (try - but fail gracefully - to) read in a
   config var for what folder is the backtracks folder. Which defaults
   to ./backtracks but can be changed to any folder.
2) make selected_audiofile available to main.sh



   ==> OUTSTANDING QUESTION:
       How do we tell it which file to play?
  1) Have a magic folder where it plays back the first one
  2) Have a prompt that takes what you type as the argument for what
   to play
  3) Have a magic folder, have it list the contents with numbers next
   to them, then have it ask you which # you want to play (DING DING
   DING)
     --> This should happen first thing, before anything else is invoked...   

** Make launch EXIT 1 if something isn't installed ...

1) Now that we have four jack capture channels and have things routed
   right, does it work as expected ??

1.5) Load configuration file for things like audacity, meterbridge

1.75) can Borderlands/loops consist of symlinks?

2) Unity Launcher


New thought:
Would it be possible to make a unity launcher that allows you to drag
   wav files onto the Borderlands icon, and have it copy those files
   into /loops/????????????????//
At the very least there should be a right click option for "Open loops folder"
