1) Now that we have four jack capture channels and have things routed
   right, does it work as expected ??

1.75) can Borderlands/loops consist of symlinks?
1.8) If so, can we make an icon that executes making links to files
   passed to it, in the loops directory? Just a script that acts on an
   arbitrary number of files, making a link to each one, in the
   desired directory

2) Unity Launcher


New thought:
Would it be possible to make a unity launcher that allows you to drag
   wav files onto the Borderlands icon, and have it copy those files
   into /loops/????????????????//
At the very least there should be a right click option for "Open loops folder"
