Qjackctl solution lies in the PATCHBAY functionality;
sessions are NOT what you want.
So try again but loading patches not presets
you have a fully working patchbay for rakarrack set up working
so try that

New thought:
Would it be possible to make a unity launcher that allows you to drag
   wav files onto the Borderlands icon, and have it copy those files
   into /loops/????????????????//
At the very least there should be a right click option for "Open loops folder"
