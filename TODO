X) Is MOC broken?

1) Now that we have four jack capture channels and have things routed
   right, does it work as expected ??
2) Unity Launcher


New thought:
Would it be possible to make a unity launcher that allows you to drag
   wav files onto the Borderlands icon, and have it copy those files
   into /loops/????????????????//
At the very least there should be a right click option for "Open loops folder"
