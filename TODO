1) Still need to fix jack patchbay.
   a) only one speaker is going into jack_capture??
   b) jack play is still going into jack-capture ??
1.75) can Borderlands/loops consist of symlinks?
1.8) If so, can we make an icon that executes making links to files
   passed to it, in the loops directory? Just a script that acts on an
   arbitrary number of files, making a link to each one, in the
   desired directory

2) Unity Launcher

3) Put licenses everywhere
