1) Use wmctrl to move everything to different places, with borderlands
   covering up the current terminal and moc ... and have those be the
   only ones for workspace one; so that when you close borderlands the 
   first thing
   you see is the terminal that launched it, from which you can press
   any key and quit everything.
2) Redo the patchbay to include moc going into input 3 of
   jack_capture. Save that.
3) also save a patchbay that doesn't use rakarrack.


New thought:
Would it be possible to make a unity launcher that allows you to drag
   wav files onto the Borderlands icon, and have it copy those files
   into /loops/????????????????//
At the very least there should be a right click option for "Open loops folder"
